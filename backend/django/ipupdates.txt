heads up to whoever is going to run this project locally.
When you connect to a new wi-fi network, check your machine's local ip by typing [ipconfig] into the windows terminal

After that, you need to update the following files:
frontend/UploadScreen.js
- change line 35 when it is getting data from axios into the appropriate ip address

myproject/settings.py
- change line 29 to include the new ip address
- change line 132 and 133 to the new ip address

run the server by declaring the network variable in the terminal
[
    set REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=IP_ADDRESS_HERE
]
and running the project on lan
[
    npx expo start --lan
]
